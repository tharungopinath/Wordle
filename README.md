# üü© Wordle (Tkinter GUI Version)

This is a graphical recreation of the popular Wordle game, built using Python and the Tkinter GUI library. Instead of typing in a terminal, players interact with an easy-to-use graphical interface featuring color-coded tiles, feedback messages, and a visual on-screen keyboard.

## üß† Gameplay Overview

Players have **six attempts** to guess a secret five-letter word. After each guess, feedback is provided to guide the next attempt:

- üü© **Green** ‚Äì Correct letter in the correct position  
- üü® **Yellow** ‚Äì Correct letter in the wrong position  
- ‚¨ú **Grey** ‚Äì Letter not in the word  

The game ends when you either guess the word or run out of attempts.

## üéÆ Features

- Full graphical user interface (GUI) using **Tkinter**
- Visual tile grid that updates based on each guess
- On-screen **keyboard tracker** that updates to show which letters are:
  - üü© correct and in the right place
  - üü® correct but in the wrong place
  - ‚¨ú incorrect
- Pop-up windows for:
  - Incorrect word length
  - Invalid words (not in the dictionary)
  - Victory screen with trophy graphic üéâ
  - Game over screen with the correct answer revealed
- Restart button for replayability
- Centered window on launch with custom icon and background images

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The on-screen keyboard is **not clickable**‚Äîit acts purely as a visual aid showing the status of letters used.


All assets (`wordledictionary.txt` and the `images/` folder) must be placed in the same directory as `wordle.py` for the game to function properly.
